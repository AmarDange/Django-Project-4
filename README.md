The Agile Methodology was used to plan this project. This was implemented through Github and the Project Board. Through the use of the Kanban board in the projects view in Github, the project was divided into a few different sections: 

* To Do- (All the User stories were initially entered in the 'To Do' column)
* In Progress- (then during development story they were moved into the 'In Progress' column)
* Done- (and then finally they get moved into 'Done' once the development completes)
