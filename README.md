## Tasks

The tasks for the website development process was closely followed as mentioned in CI's Django module "I Think Therefore I Blog" walkthrough project. The task is generally the developers step towards preparing the app.
The tasks that I have followed during the development phase were carried out in this order.
## Agile Methodology

The Agile Methodology was used to plan this project. This was implemented through Github and the Project Board. Through the use of the Kanban board in the projects view in Github, the project was divided into a few different sections: 

* To Do- (All the User stories were initially entered in the 'To Do' column)
* In Progress- (then during development story they were moved into the 'In Progress' column)
* Done- (and then finally they get moved into 'Done' once the development completes)

![Color Palette]

### Typography

Fonts were imported using Google Fonts. Roboto was used throughout with a backup of sans-serif. It was chosen for easy readability for users.

### Imagery

All the imagery is related to the Maharashtrain culture, food, tourist destination and website design. Some images including carousel are static. The remaining imagery was uploaded by the author to the database.

### Wireframes

## Database Diagram

Smart Draw was used to create a database schema to visualise the types of custom models the project requires. This schema was used as a guide to what needed to be added to each model. Below is the Database structure that this project is based on. The relationship between Entities Post, Author, Destination and Comment are shown in this diagram.
