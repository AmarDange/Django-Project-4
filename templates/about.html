                <p>Going by the Archaeological pieces of evidence the history of Maharashtra dates back to the 3rd
                    century. An excavation survey conducted in 1958 suggests Daimabad, a site in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra
                    belonging to Harappan civilization. The Vatakas, Rashtrkutas, Chalukyas, Yadavas had been few Hindu dynasties
                    that reigned the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions. In the year 1296 AD, Ala-ud-din Khalji invaded the Deccan region by
                    defeating the Yadavas. Then came the Tughlaq Dynasty who reigned till 1347 AD and extended the empire till Madurai
                    followed by the Bahmani Sultanate of Bijapur who ruled the region for 150 years. By the year 1674, the Bijapur
                    Sultanate went in control of the Maratha Empire that was led by the legendary Chhatrapati Shivaji. After his death in the year
                    1680, his two sons Sambhaji and Rajaram ruled the Maratha Empire. From 1712 to 1804, the Peshwa Dynasty took the
                    Maratha Kingdom. During their reign, the region was basking in glory until the three Anglo - Maratha wars when the Peshwas
                    succumbed to British
                    tyranny which marked the beginning of the British Era in India. The region was governed by the
                    Bombay Presidency in the
                    years 1848 and 1853 which included most parts of northern Deccan until India got independence in
                    1947. The state went
                    through plenty of political overhauling and in the year 1960, the Bombay Reorganization Act was
                    passed and it emerged as
                    the modern state of Maharashtra. This year remains a hallmark in the history of Maharashtra.</p>

                    Various cultural
                    affiliations blend together to live harmoniously in the land of prosperity. Maharashtra is divided
                    into small regions
                    and each region is diverse in the form of dialects, folk songs, food, ethnicity. Maharashtra is a
                    melting pot of
                    different races, traditions, and classes. The engaging traditions of Waghya Murali, Potraj, Vasudev,

                    Hindus, however, there
                    has been a prevailing sense of secularism in the state that embraces other religions with great
                    respect and diversity
                    inclusion. Maharashtrians are amiable and cordial and treat outsiders with love and gratitude.

                    language of the state and there are 38 other languages spoken by Adivasis, tribals, nomadic tribes,
                    and denotified
                    communities making it one of the most linguistically wealthy states of India.</p>
